Sitation
========
Sitation is a simple CMS made with Node.JS and Express.

Requirements
------------
*Node.JS 8.12 or higher
*MongoDB 4 or higher
*The installation folder must be writable. (you can change this after installation, but config.js will always need to be writable)

Quick Setup
-----------
    git clone https://github.com/ComputeLinux/sitation.git
    cd sitation
    npm install
    node app.js

Your site will initially be available at localhost:3000. You can change this during the setup process. To change this, as well as  other settings after installation, edit config.js.
**DO NOT DELETE CONFIG.DEFAULT.JS AFTER INSTALLATION.**
